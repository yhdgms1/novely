# Novely Contributing Guide

## Repo Setup

1. Fork repository and clone
2. Install `pnpm` if not installed
3. Run `pnpm i` in the root folder.

## Pull Request Guidelines

- Checkout a topic branch from a base branch (e.g. `main`), and merge back against that branch.

## TypeScript

Please, you TypeScript.

You can add `any` in new code, but not in existing code. You can use `as` type cast in case that's needed.
