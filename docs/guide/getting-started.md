Then follow the prompts! Novely's templates uses Vite, you can get all related information on how to work with it on Vite's [website](https://vitejs.dev/guide/#index-html-and-project-root).

## Alternatives

### Standalone Package

::: warning
Standalone is deprecated and will be removed.
:::

You might not want to use bundler. Here you go! We have a [@novely/standalone](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@novely/standalone) package. Basically, you just need to add it to your project using CDN or placing script alongside your `index.html`.

### Download from GitHub

You can download source code from GitHub. All the templates are located at [packages/create-novely](https://github.com/yhdgms1/novely/tree/main/packages/create-novely) folder.
