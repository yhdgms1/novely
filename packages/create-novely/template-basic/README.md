# Novely + SolidJS

## Getting Started

```bash
npm i # install dependencies
npm run dev # start dev server
npm run build # build game for production
npm run preview # test production build
```

## Personalization

Let's get down to personalizing the project!

- Open `index.html`, change the `title` and `description`
- Update storage in `./src/engine.ts`
- Open `src/story.ts` and write you'r own game. That's it!
